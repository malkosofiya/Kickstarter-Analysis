# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to determine outcomes base on the launch date and goals. As well as, uncover trends and provide data in an easy-to-read format.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first step of this analysis was to creat a pivot table that helps determine the number of campaigns that were successful, failed and cancelled based on the month they launched. Filters for the parent category and years have also been added to facilitate the search and allow versatility.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To perform this analysis a table has been created to compare the goal amount and the campaign outcome. We have devided goals into different categories (such as less than $1000 and $50000 or more) which allowed to drill deeper into the data. COUNTIFS formula has been used to successfully identity the number of campaigns that were successful, failed and cancelled. Additionally, this data has been convertate to percentages to allow an easy effortless view.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
Completed the analysis by providing different view points, inclding an in-depth look into performance by category/sub-category.
Was able to determine trends based on the launch date per outcome indicating month May as the best performing month.
